# Lottery_App

This is a basic console lottery application written in C#, where the user is prompted to enter numbers and the program generates an equally amount of numbers that are checked against the first group for matches. 

This a simple project I developed as part of the units ICTPRG433 Test Software and ICTPRG440 Apply introductory programming skills in different
languages for the Certificate IV in IT (Programming) at NMTAFE.

Instructions given:
Create a console application that emulates a lottery of numbers. Your program must allow the user to select their own numbers from a predefined range of values. Once all values have been selected the program will then generate a series of random numbers and compare the users' values with those. The number of values that match with those the user picked from the randomly generated numbers will be displayed for the user to see how many they got correct.
